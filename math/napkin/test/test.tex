\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test
	\item Vimtex is probably going to seriously take some time for me to get used to but I think I'll probably end up using this most of the time. I really really need to change the colour scheme because "mispelled" words are turned into this fucking unreadable white on white blob 	
 	\item Second item
	\item Testing math stuff $\forall g\in G$
\end{enumerate}
\section{Testing snippets}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a
	\item  $1 + 1 = 2$
	\item $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$
	\item 2
	\item fixing typos is hard, which is why computers will fix everything
\end{enumerate}

2 + 2 = 4
